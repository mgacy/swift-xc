# Configuration

You can configure Rulesync by creating a `rulesync.jsonc` file in the root of your project.

## JSON Schema Support

Rulesync provides a JSON Schema for editor validation and autocompletion. Add the `$schema` property to your `rulesync.jsonc`:

```jsonc
// rulesync.jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://github.com/dyoshikawa/rulesync/releases/latest/download/config-schema.json",
  "targets": ["claudecode"],
  "features": ["rules"],
}
```

## Configuration Options

Example:

```jsonc
// rulesync.jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://github.com/dyoshikawa/rulesync/releases/latest/download/config-schema.json",

  // List of tools to generate configurations for. You can specify "*" to generate all tools.
  "targets": ["cursor", "claudecode", "opencode", "codexcli"],

  // Features to generate. You can specify "*" to generate all features.
  "features": ["rules", "mcp", "commands", "subagents", "hooks", "permissions"],

  // Output root directories to generate files into.
  // Basically, you can specify `["."]` only.
  // However, for example, if your project is a monorepo and you have to launch the AI agent at each package directory, you can specify multiple output roots.
  "outputRoots": ["."],

  // Delete existing files before generating
  "delete": true,

  // Verbose output
  "verbose": false,

  // Silent mode - suppress all output (except errors)
  "silent": false,

  // Advanced options
  "global": false, // Generate for global(user scope) configuration files
  "simulateCommands": false, // Generate simulated commands
  "simulateSubagents": false, // Generate simulated subagents
  "simulateSkills": false, // Generate simulated skills

  // Derive `agentsmd.subprojectPath` from each non-root rule's `globs`, so a
  // rule with `globs: ["packages/api/**/*"]` is written as
  // `packages/api/AGENTS.md` (nested AGENTS.md) by the targets that nest,
  // instead of `.agents/memories/<rule>.md`. The directory is the leading
  // wildcard-free part every glob shares; a rule whose globs have none (e.g.
  // `["src/**/*.ts", "test/**/*.ts"]`) or disagree silently keeps its default
  // placement. Only a rule that sets `agentsmd: { subprojectPath: "auto" }`
  // itself is warned about when nothing can be derived; that value also opts
  // a single rule in regardless of this option, and `agentsmd: {
  // subprojectPath: "" }` opts a single rule out. An explicit directory
  // always wins and `root: true` rules never nest.
  // Turning it on moves existing outputs, so run `generate --delete` once.
  "deriveSubprojectPathFromGlobs": false,

  // Naming for command files flattened for tools without subdirectory
  // command support (e.g. Cursor): "basename" (default) keeps only the
  // filename, so `pj/test.md` and `ops/test.md` collide and the last one
  // wins; "path" joins the directory segments into the filename
  // (`pj/test.md` -> `pj-test.md`), which reduces collisions but cannot
  // rule them out (a literal `pj-test.md` also maps to `pj-test.md`); the
  // collision warning still applies.
  // Tools that support subdirectories (e.g. Claude Code) are unaffected.
  // Note: switching from "basename" to "path" renames the generated files
  // (e.g. `test.md` -> `pj-test.md`); run `rulesync generate` with
  // `delete: true` (or `--delete`) once after switching, otherwise the
  // stale old flat-named files remain alongside the new ones.
  "flattenedCommandNaming": "basename",

  // Language the AI should answer in. Omit it to say nothing about language.
  // See the "Response Language" section for what each tool receives.
  // "language": "ja",

  // When true (default), `rulesync gitignore` only emits entries for the
  // tools listed in `targets`. Set to false to emit entries for all supported
  // tools regardless of `targets`.
  //
  // Note: Entries for `agentsmd` (AGENTS.md and related paths) are always
  // appended even when `gitignoreTargetsOnly` is true and `agentsmd` is
  // absent from `targets`. AGENTS.md is a de facto standard read by many AI
  // tools regardless of the target set, so its gitignore entries are emitted
  // unconditionally to prevent accidental commits of generated rule files.
  "gitignoreTargetsOnly": true,

  // Declarative rule and skill sources — installed via 'rulesync install'
  // See the "Declarative Sources" section for details.
  // "sources": [
  //   { "source": "owner/repo" },
  //   { "source": "org/repo", "skills": ["specific-skill"] },
  //   { "source": "org/standards", "rules": ["testing-guidelines"] },
  // ],
}
```

## Per-Target Features

The `targets` option accepts both an array and an object format. Use the
object format when you want to declare per-target feature configuration in
a single place — the object keys are the target tools, and each value
carries the features to generate for that tool:

```jsonc
// rulesync.jsonc
{
  "targets": {
    "claudecode": ["rules", "commands"],
    "cursor": ["rules", "mcp"],
    "copilot": ["rules", "subagents"],
  },
}
```

In this example:

- `claudecode` generates rules and commands
- `cursor` generates rules and MCP configuration
- `copilot` generates rules and subagents

> **Important:** When `targets` is in object form, the top-level `features`
> field must be omitted. Declaring both would double-define the target
> set, so the config loader rejects that combination.

You can also use `*` (wildcard) inside a target's value to enable every
feature for that tool:

```jsonc
{
  "targets": {
    "claudecode": ["*"], // Generate all features for Claude Code
    "cursor": ["rules"], // Only rules for Cursor
  },
}
```

### Per-feature options

Some features accept additional configuration. To pass options through, use
the object form for a target's value instead of an array. Each feature key
maps to either `true`/`false` (enable/disable) or an options object.

```jsonc
{
  "gitignoreDestination": "gitignore",
  "targets": {
    "claudecode": {
      "gitignoreDestination": "gitattributes",
      "rules": { "ruleDiscoveryMode": "explicit" },
      "ignore": {
        "fileMode": "local",
        "gitignoreDestination": "gitignore",
      },
    },
  },
}
```

`gitignoreDestination` controls where `rulesync gitignore` writes path entries.
You can set it:

- at **root level** (`gitignoreDestination`)
- at **tool level** (`targets.<tool>.gitignoreDestination`)
- or at **tool × feature level**
  (`targets.<tool>.<feature>.gitignoreDestination`)

Allowed values:

- `"gitignore"` (default)
- `"gitattributes"`

Priority is **more specific wins**:

1. tool × feature level
2. tool level
3. root level
4. default (`"gitignore"`)

The current per-feature options are:

| Target       | Feature  | Option                 | Values                                                                         | Default       |
| ------------ | -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| `claudecode` | `rules`  | `ruleDiscoveryMode`    | `"none"` / `"explicit"`                                                        | tool default  |
| any          | `rules`  | `includeLocalRoot`     | `true` / `false` (when `false`, `localRoot` rules are skipped for this target) | `true`        |
| `claudecode` | `ignore` | `fileMode`             | `"shared"` (settings.json) / `"local"` (settings.local.json)                   | `"shared"`    |
| any          | any      | `gitignoreDestination` | `"gitignore"` / `"gitattributes"`                                              | `"gitignore"` |

See [`docs/reference/file-formats.md`](../reference/file-formats.md#where-ignore-patterns-are-written-per-tool)
for the rationale behind the Claude Code default and when to switch to
`"local"`.

## Response Language

The root `language` key steers the language the AI answers in. It accepts one of `en`, `ja`, `zh-CN`, `zh-TW`, `ko`, `fr`, `de`, `es`, `pt-BR`, `ru`, has no CLI flag, and can be overridden per developer from `rulesync.local.jsonc`. When it is omitted, Rulesync says nothing about language; `en` is therefore an explicit instruction, not the default.

```jsonc
// rulesync.jsonc
{
  "language": "ja",
}
```

What the `rules` feature generates from it depends on the tool:

- **Claude Code** has a native `language` setting, so the key is written as `"language": "japanese"` into `.claude/settings.local.json` (project scope) or `~/.claude/settings.json` (global scope, since Claude Code reads no `~/.claude/settings.local.json`) and `CLAUDE.md` is left as it is. Only the `language` key is touched; everything else in the settings file is preserved, and the file is never created or modified while the key is unset. Removing `language` later does not retract the key already written: the settings file is shared with your own configuration, so Rulesync never deletes from it, and the value stays until you remove it by hand.
- **Every other tool** gets the instruction appended to the generated root rule file — the file built from your `root: true` rule (`AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.cursor/rules/overview.mdc`, and so on). Nested rules never carry it, and neither does a `localRoot: true` rule's separate personal file. For a tool that files every rule side by side (Cursor and the fixed-name targets) with more than one `root: true` rule, only the file built from the first root rule carries the block. The block is separated from your content by a thematic break:

  ```md
  ---

  You must always answer in Japanese. On the other hand, reasoning (thinking) should be in English to improve token efficiency.
  ```

  `rulesync import` recognizes the block for every supported language and strips it (with a warning, since the instruction is not carried into `.rulesync/rules/` — the `language` key in `rulesync.jsonc` is what keeps it), so importing a generated file and generating again yields one block rather than two. `rulesync convert` re-adds the block to the destination's root file when `language` is set.

## Local Configuration

Rulesync supports a local configuration file (`rulesync.local.jsonc`) for machine-specific or developer-specific settings. This file is automatically added to `.gitignore` by `rulesync gitignore` and should not be committed to the repository.

**Configuration Priority** (highest to lowest):

1. CLI options
2. `rulesync.local.jsonc`
3. `rulesync.jsonc`
4. Default values

Example usage:

```jsonc
// rulesync.local.jsonc (not committed to git)
{
  "$schema": "https://github.com/dyoshikawa/rulesync/releases/latest/download/config-schema.json",
  // Override targets for local development
  "targets": ["claudecode"],
  // Enable verbose output for debugging
  "verbose": true,
}
```

## Target Order and File Conflicts

When multiple targets write to the same output file, **the last target in the array wins**. This is the "last-wins" behavior.

For example, both `agentsmd` and `opencode` generate `AGENTS.md`:

```jsonc
{
  // opencode wins because it comes last
  "targets": ["agentsmd", "opencode"],
  "features": ["rules"],
}
```

In this case:

1. `agentsmd` generates `AGENTS.md` first
2. `opencode` generates `AGENTS.md` second, overwriting the previous file

If you want `agentsmd`'s output instead, reverse the order:

```jsonc
{
  // agentsmd wins because it comes last
  "targets": ["opencode", "agentsmd"],
  "features": ["rules"],
}
```
